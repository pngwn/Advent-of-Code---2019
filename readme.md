# Advent of Code - 2019

Maybe I'll do it this year. I'm not very bright but I like puzzles.

The code is in `advent/` (e.g: `advent/day-01.js`) the inputs are in `advent/inputs/` (e.g. `advent/inputs/day-01.js`).

Code and tests are in the same file.

## Run the code

You can run the tests for a given day via the command line, tests are how we run the code because i'm lazy:

yarn:

```
yarn advent 1
# or yarn advent day-01
# or yarn advent day1
```

npm:

```
npm run advent 1
# or npm run advent day-01
# or npm run advent day1
```

It is really only the number that matters.

You can run the tests for all days by running the command with no arguments.

yarn:

```
yarn advent
```

npm:

```
npm run advent
```
